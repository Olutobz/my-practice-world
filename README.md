## Self-Work Practices
>I learnt and practice Udacity's functional & object Oriented Programming, It is a free course I enjoyed and find very 
resourceful and beginners worthy. I added some of the exercises I practice while learning how to program in java using 
the book titled "How to program in java" by DIETEL.
